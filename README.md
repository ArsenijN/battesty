Replacement for Windows's ETA of battery lifetime

# Why it specifically exists?
Windows 11 shits on my HP EliteBook 830 G5 w/Intel i5 8350U, and doesn't like to show the remaining time of work from battery, **but** my friend's HP EliteBook 845 G10 w/Ryzen 5 7545U have not only "ETA", but also new battery icon!!!!!!!!!

This is why I want to replace the Windows's battery icon with mine, and also "implement" (inspire from; add simmilar features from) AccuBattery to the battesty (why not?)
