TODO:
- [ ] Add settings and info page later
- [ ] Fix icon
- [ ] calculate annual capacity loss and determined battery capacity (not necessary since batteries can tell by themself what's their full capacity and design one)
- [ ] Lightning isn't yellow but black
- [ ] Add the green knob at the top as sign that it's 90~100% charged (close to where battery knob is placed)


Completed:
- [x] Change the canvas size for hi-res (32x32)
- [x] Update the icon on app start (so it will not hang on latest saved measurement)
- [x] Add so when battesty detects charge, it will also show ETA of charging
- [x] When charging was detected, reset discharge ETA or calculate it, based of normalized values of usage
