Battesty (or batterty) - improvements list:
1. Add so when battesty detects charge, it will also show ETA of charging - it already do that!!!!!
2. When charging was detected, reset discharge ETA or calculate it, based of normalized values of usage - it already do that!!!!
3. Fix icon
4. Add settings and info page later
5. fix issue that on app start, empty terminal appears



calculate annual capacity loss and determined battery capacity (not necessary since batteries can tell by themself what's their full capacity and design one)




Lightning isn't yellow but black
Change the canvas size for hi-res
Update the icon on app start (so it will not hang on latest saved measurement)
Add the green knob at the top as sign that it's 90~100% charged (close to where battery knob is placed)
